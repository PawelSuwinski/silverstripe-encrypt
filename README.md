SilverStripe Encrypt module
==================

Easily add encryption to your DataObjects

Currently, only Text and HTMLText are supported. Simply replace your text fields by their
corresponding DBEncryptedText or DBEncryptedHTMLText.

TODO:
- Add easily searchable encrypted text

Note: version for SilverStripe 4 coming soon!

Security
==================

Make sure that the private key is not accessible! The key will be generated by default
in your baseFolder. You can prevent access by using appropriate htaccess protection.
You can also define the key as a constant, like

	define('ENCRYPT_SHARED_KEY','WBTGGWSRPG89uMiqlkpqztrgFidIRYzKO1DIqu93DxB')

(note : this is a demo key, do not use this one!)

Compatibility
==================
Tested with 3.6
